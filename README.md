The public tools I use to hunt on web servers

Go to Port_Scanner folder which I made to discover reachable and unreachable hosts and if the host is reachable then the tool will start bruteforcing the ports from wordlist.txt to discover the reachable ports.
Red coloured unreachable sites are unreachable and the reachable hosts will start being bruteforced to discover ports.
